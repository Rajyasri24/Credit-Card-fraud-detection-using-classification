The Banking industry is the most essential functional unit for a countryâ€™s economy. When we come across 
the use of credit card, it came into play in the banking sector in the year 1958 in California by BOA. Credit card is 
the timeliest mode of payment in terms of pre-set credit limit. When we see with augmentation of technology, cashless 
payments have touched the peak. As the banking sector has also entered the scenario of digitalization, credit card 
usage is also increasing. Due to this expansion in technology, credit card fraudulent crimes are proliferating. It is 
important to take up new measures and stringent actions to limit the crime rates. Fraudulent activities impact the 
consumers, merchants and the bank organization as well. Thus, it is important to identify the fraud activities by 
classifying suspicious data from the transactional data. To detect the credit card fraud, various data mining 
techniques could be used. Some of the data mining techniques used in this project are Support vector machine 
and Decision tree. After analysis, the support vector machine model with kernel as 
RBF works with high accuracy
